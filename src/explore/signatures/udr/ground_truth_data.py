BASED ON:
Methods for computing the UDR and UDR-A2A scores specified in "Unsupervised
Model Selection for Variational Disentangled Representation Learning"
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12614)

Github Repo:
https://github.com/google-research/disentanglement_lib/evaluation/udr/metrics/udr.py

This version does not do batch sampling but uses entirety of dataset
The batch sampling is based on a complicated workflow that is hard to emulate
Original paper says entire ordered dataset can be used...
